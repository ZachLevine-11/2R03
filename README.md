## Packages that it would be useful to learn to use
- The tidyverse, most notably *dplyr, ggplot, and modelr*.
To install, enter "install.packages("tidyverse")" (without quotes) into the R console. Remember to load the package every time you're calling one of it's built-in methods. Most notably, base R graphics methods can be cumbersome to use and unpleasing to the eye, so ggplot can be quite useful that way. Dplyr is quite great for data manipulation and contains methods you either won't find in base R, or optimized forms that are friendlier to you, the programmer.
